# Lecture 2 Introduction to Linux Notes
<br>

* What is an Operating System?

    An operating system (OS) is system software that manages a computer's hardware and software resources, acting as an interface between the user and the computer.
<br>
* What is a kernel?

    A kernel is the core component of an operating system that serves as the primary interface between a computer's hardware and its software, managing resources like the CPU, memory, and devices.
<br>
* Which other parts aside from the kernel identify an OS?
    Besides the kernel, an operating system (OS) is identified by its shell, user interface, system libraries, and file system.
<br>
* What is linux and linux distribution?
    Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel, not a complete OS, while a
Linux distribution (or distro) is a complete, user-ready operating system that includes the Linux kernel, system utilities, libraries, and applications bundled into a single, installable package.
<br>
* List at least 4 linux characteristics:
    - Open source and free
    - Secure
   - Stable and Reliable
   - Multi-user and multitasking
  <br>
* What is Debian?
Debian is a free, open-source, Linux-based operating system developed by the global Debian Project of volunteers.
<br>
* List and define the different types of licensing agreements
    - Open Source: the software may be distributed for a fee or free. The source code is distributed with the software.
   - Closed Source: the software is not distributed with the source code. The user is restricted from modifying the code.
        - Freeware: the software is free but the source code is not available.
        - Shareware: the software is free on a trial basis.
   - Free Software: the software is distributed with the source code. The software can be free of charge or obtained by a fee.
<br>
* What is Free Software? Define the 4 freedoms.
The Free Software Foundation (FSF) is a critical force in the open source world.
The FSF defines four specific software freedoms:
    - Freedom 0: use the software for any purpose.
    - Freedom 1: examine the source code and modify it as you see fit.
    - Freedom 2: redistribute the software.
    - Freedom 3: redistribute your modified software.
  <br>
* What is virtualization?
Virtualization is defined as creating virtual versions of something. It is often used to let multiple OSs run on one physical machine at the same time.
